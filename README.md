# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains code for a stock market analysis and prediction project. The project utilizes Python and various libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance, and TensorFlow, to retrieve, analyze, visualize, and predict stock market data.

##Features

1) Data retrieval: Retrieve stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library and pandas_datareader.
2) Data analysis and visualization: Analyze and visualize stock data, including historical closing prices, sales volume, moving averages, daily returns, return correlations, and more.
3) Predictive modeling: Utilize LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks in TensorFlow to build a predictive model for stock prices.
4) Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the predictive model by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) between predicted and actual stock prices.
